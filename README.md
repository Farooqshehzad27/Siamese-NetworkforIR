# 🧠 Siamese Network for Image Retrieval

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** for **image similarity and retrieval tasks** using PyTorch. The model learns to identify similar and dissimilar image pairs by learning meaningful feature embeddings.

---

## 📌 Abstract

This project explores the power of **Siamese Networks** in learning feature representations by comparing image pairs. The trained model can be used in image retrieval systems, where given a query image, the system finds similar images from a dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build and train a Siamese Neural Network using PyTorch.
- Learn embeddings that represent image similarity.
- Use contrastive loss to optimize distance between similar/dissimilar image pairs.
- Evaluate the model’s ability to distinguish similar images.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- **Source**: Custom/prepared dataset of image pairs.
- **Format**: Each sample contains a pair of images with a similarity label:
  - `1`: Similar images  
  - `0`: Dissimilar images

> You can customize the dataset loader to fit any image pair-based dataset.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 📐 Architecture: Siamese Network

- **Twin CNNs** with shared weights.
- Each branch processes an image and outputs a feature vector.
- **Euclidean distance** measures similarity between the two embeddings.



---

## 🏋️ Training Details

- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Epochs**: Configurable
- **Loss Function**: ContrastiveLoss (custom-defined)
- **Image Size**: Standardized (e.g. 100x100 or 105x105)

---

## 🖼️ Inference: How it Works

1. Input a pair of images.
2. The model generates feature vectors for both.
3. Compute the distance between the vectors.
4. If the distance is below a threshold → similar, otherwise → different.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Results

- Visualization of pair comparisons and decision boundaries.
- Plot of **contrastive loss over epochs** to show learning stability.

> More quantitative metrics like precision/recall or retrieval accuracy can be added.
